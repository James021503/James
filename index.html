            <p> HDCVI technology supports up to 4K ultra high definition resolution. With 4 times the pixels of 1080P, it presents a true-to-life image with impressive clarity that captures even the tiniest of details. As the very first technology to bring 4K-over-coax to the market, HDCVI comes with a complete product portfolio. The 4K box camera (DH-HAC-HF3805G) features Starlight capability and offers a full color image even in extreme low-light environments. The 4K IR bullet and dome cameras (DH-HAC-HFW3802E-Z & DH-HAC-HDBW3802E-Z) feature 120dB true WDR and long-distance IR range. The 4K multi-sensor camera(DH-HAC-PFW3601-A180) and fisheye camera (DH-HAC-EBW3802) capture a panoramic image which covers a wider monitoring area.</p>
            <p>Dahua HDCVI cameras are separated into the Pro, Lite and Cooper Series, which range from high performance with project oriented features to a cost/performance balance. Users can select cameras based on their needs. HDCVI cameras are used in applications where existing analog infrastructure is available and users have a need for the latest technologies, including 4M/4K resolution, IoT over coax, Power over Coax (PoC), and more. </p>
